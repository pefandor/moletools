        "question": "Why are Unix timestamps useful?",
        "answer": "Timestamps are ideal for storing dates in databases, APIs, and logs because they're timezone-independent, easy to compare/sort, and occupy minimal space (just a number). They avoid ambiguities with date formats and daylight saving time."

      },
      {
        "question": "Will I lose image quality when converting to WebP?",

        "question": "How much can I reduce my image file size?",
        "answer": "Compression results vary by image type and content. Typically, you can expect 40-60% size reduction for photos (JPEG) and 25-50% for graphics (PNG) without noticeable quality loss. Some images may compress even more."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between resizing and compressing?",
        "answer": "Resizing changes the image dimensions (width/height in pixels), which reduces file size by having fewer pixels. Compressing reduces file size by optimizing how the image data is stored, without changing dimensions. You can do both for maximum size reduction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which format should I use - JPEG, PNG, or WebP?",
        "answer": "Use JPEG for photos and images with many colors. Use PNG for graphics, logos, screenshots, or images requiring transparency. Use WebP for the best compression with quality - it's ideal for modern websites and supports both photos and transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will compression affect image quality?",
        "answer": "At moderate quality settings (70-85), compression has minimal visible impact on most images. The tool shows you the before/after file sizes so you can find the optimal balance. You can always adjust quality and re-compress if needed."

        "question": "How much data can I encode in a QR code?",
        "answer": "QR codes can store up to 4,296 alphanumeric characters or 7,089 numeric characters. However, more data creates denser, more complex codes that may be harder to scan. For best results, keep URLs under 200 characters and use URL shorteners for longer links."

        "question": "What opacity level should I use for my watermark?",
        "answer": "For subtle watermarks that don't distract from the image, use 20-40% opacity. For more visible copyright protection, use 50-70%. For maximum visibility, use 80-100%. The default 30% provides good balance between visibility and subtlety."

      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best position for a watermark?",
        "answer": "For copyright protection, bottom-right or bottom-left corners are common as they're less intrusive. Center position works well for 'CONFIDENTIAL' or 'DRAFT' stamps. Top positions are good for branding. Choose based on your image composition and purpose."

        "question": "What is a hash and why use it?",
        "answer": "A hash is a fixed-size string generated from input data using a mathematical algorithm. Hashes are used for data integrity verification, password storage, digital signatures, and file comparison. The same input always produces the same hash, but even tiny changes in input create completely different hashes."
      },

        "question": "Which hash algorithm should I use?",
        "answer": "SHA-256 is recommended for most modern applications - it's secure and widely supported. SHA-512 offers higher security for sensitive data. MD5 and SHA-1 are legacy algorithms with known vulnerabilities - use them only for non-security purposes like checksums. Never use MD5 or SHA-1 for password hashing."

      },
      {
        "question": "Are hashes reversible?",
        "answer": "No! Hash functions are one-way - you cannot reverse a hash back to the original data. This makes them ideal for password storage. However, weak passwords can be cracked using rainbow tables or brute force, so always use strong, unique passwords."
